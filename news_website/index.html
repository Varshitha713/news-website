    <h2>India win Asian Champions Trophy hockey: How Jugraj Singh, with an assist from Harmanpreet Singh, became unlikely hero</h2>
    <p>After scoring from penalty corners and penalty strokes during his entire international career, Jugraj Singh scored his first-ever field goal in his 63rd match for India. And what a time for it.
        Sixteen years later, it wasn’t a surprise that six players in the squad that lined up against India for the final were from Inner Mongolia.
         Shaped by club coaches – some of whom were international experts – even when they were in school, the current crop of China’s players are arguably the first to come through a
          proper channel.

    <h2>Fee hike: Govt allows private medical colleges to charge 5 times more for BAMS, homeopathy, unani courses</h2>
    <p >The Maharashtra government has allowed private medical colleges to charge up to five times more than the regular fees set by the Fee Regulatory Authority (FRA) for management quota seats 
        in Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS), Homeopathy, and Unani medicine courses, at both undergraduate and postgraduate (PG) levels.
         This new fee structure, applicable from the academic year 2024-25, will impact 15 per cent of the seats under the management and Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quota at all private, unaided medical colleges offering these courses.
         Previously, colleges were permitted to charge three to four times the regular fees for these seats. As a result of the new policy, fees for management quota seats in BAMS, Homeopathy, and Unani courses could soar as high as Rs 13.5 lakh.
          The normal fees for the general category is around Rs 2.75 lakh.
